        <h2>Hi, my name is Shereen</h2>
        <p>
I am a product designer that specializes in both website and mobile applications. Recently graduating from UC Irvine with a B.S. in Informatics, I use my HCI specialization in order to create human-centered designs.

When I'm not creating iterative designs, I enjoy keeping up with hockey, eating at new restaurants, and watching the Office. 

You can view my full resume <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. (when I add it lol)
